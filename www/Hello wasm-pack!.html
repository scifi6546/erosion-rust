            <h1>Shallow Water Equations</h1>
            The Shallow Water equations are used for describing the flow of water when the depth is low
            relative to the wave length. They are derived by integrating the Navierâ€“Stokes equations accros
            the depth. A conservative form of the shallow water equations are shown below, where rho is the density of
            water
            and
            h is the water height.

            <h1>What Are they</h1>
            <h1>How Are they Used?</h1>

            The shallow water equations are derived from the derived from Navier stokes equations. What Are they How Do
            they
            Work? How Are they Used?
            <h1>
                Simulation
            </h1>
            Below is a real time simulation of the shallow water equations. It only uses the first equation (which
            describes
            the
            conservation of mass) in order to simulate
            water.
            The simulation operates on two steps. In the first step the water velocities are calculated and then the
            water
            velocities are used to change the water heights. The equations used in the simulation are shown below.

            The first two equations describe the velocity and the last two describe how the velocity is related to the
            height.
