    <h1>Shallow Water Equations</h1>
    The Shallow Water equations are used for describing the flow of water when the depth is low
    relative to the wave length. They are derived by integrating the Navierâ€“Stokes equations accros
    the depth. A conservative form of the shallow water equations are shown below, where rho is the density of water and
    h is the water height.

    <h1>What Are they</h1>
    <h1>How Are they Used?</h1>

    The shallow water equations are derived from the derived from Navier stokes equations. What Are they How Do they
    Work? How Are they Used?

        Simulation
    </h1>
    Below is a real time simulation of the shallow water equations. It only uses the first equation (which describes the
    conservation of mass) in order to simulate
    water.
    The simulation operates on two steps. In the first step the water velocities are calculated and then the
