            <h1>Shallow Water Equations</h1>
            <h3> Written By Nicholas Alexeev</h3>
            <h1>Why is Simulating Water Useful?</h1>
            Simulating the flow of fluids is very important because fluids such as water play a large role in everyones'
            lives.
            For example in order to predict the risk of flooding in an area one has to have the ability to simulate
            water in order to have an idea of where it would flow. Predicting flooding is very important because it
            allows housing developers to avoid areas that are at high risk of getting flooded. Another important use is
            predicting erosion. Water
            plays a major role in erosion and to accurately predict erosion it is useful to have the ability to simulate
            the process of water picking up material and moving it downstream. Erosion modeling is also important
            because it can determine crop yield, If soil is deposited then crop yield may go up but if soil is removed a
            farms crop yield may decrease.

            <h1>Description of Equations</h1>
            The Shallow Water equations are used for describing the flow of water when the depth is low
            relative to the wave length. They are derived by integrating the Navierâ€“Stokes equations across
            the depth. A conservative form of the shallow water equations is shown below where h is the water height, u
            is the water velocity in the x
            direction and v is the water velocity in the y direction. The following equations operate on a non rotating
            earth.

            The shallow water equations are commonly used to model tsunamis. The shallow water equations are valid for
            tsunamis because
            tsunamis are gravitational waves whose wavelength is large relative to the wave depth. Tsunamis are waved
            generated by a displacement of water often caused by an earthquake or landslide. Tsunamis are very important
            to understand because they can have a devastating impact on people. For example the Good Friday Earthquake
            of 1964 not only destroyed Anchorage but a tsunami generated by this earthquake devastated Valdez. The
            shallow water
            equations are also useful for modeling erosion because
            the equations can be applied to modeling of water on uneven surfaces and the water can modify the surface it
            is flowing on.
            <h1>Limitations</h1>
            The shallow water's equations are only valid when the wavelength is large relative to the wave depth and
            there is no flow along the depth axis. This means that the equations can not correctly simulate phenomenon
            such as cresting waves or currents that vary with depth because there is no formulation for vertical
            velocity. Not simulating vertical velocity is a useful property because it simplifies the formulation of the
            equations and makes simulation computationally easier.
            <h1>
                Simulation
            </h1>
            Shown below is a real time simulation of the shallow water equations. The model does not preserve momentum,
            thus the equations used and shown below are simplified.

            The simulation uses the Arakawa scheme [1] and is shown below. The velocities are offset from the height
            grid in
            order to
            represent flow between height cells. If the velocity components were not offset then the water velocities
            would represent net flux of water at a given point rather then the velocity of water between two points.

            The simulation operates on the Matsuno scheme. First the program makes one half time step forwards and then
            it uses the information from the half timestep inorder to calculate the change in velocity and heights for a
            full time step. The changes in heights and velocities are then applied to the initial time step.


            <h1>
                Limitations of Model
            </h1>
            The model can enter unstable states and breakdown. One explnation could be that the system enters an
            unstable oscilation and linear dampening is not strong enough to break the system out of the oscilations.
